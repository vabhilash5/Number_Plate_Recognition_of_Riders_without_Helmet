# Number_Plate_Recognition_of_Riders_without_Helmet_YOLOv7

- Two models are trained one is object detection model for two-wheelers riders and that object images
cropped then send to helmet and name plate object detection model.
- Collected images from different sources on internet. Annotated images by using roboflow and trained
YOLOv7 model and saved custom weights.
- Prediction of riders without helmet is shown if the model is very confident since we canâ€™t fine rider
without high confidence.
